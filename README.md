# Using JavaScript 

I learn how to build a simple Web and display it in React.js 
the code is simple and I get a response for the API which in this case is a weather API, in the process I am using the knowledge in React.

# React documentation
Try React
React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.

## Add React to website
Add React in One Minute
In this section, we will show how to add a React component to an existing HTML page. You can follow along with your own website, or create an empty HTML file to practice.
There will be no complicated tools or install requirements — to complete this section, you only need an internet connection, and a minute of your time.
# JSX
Add JSX to a Project
Adding JSX to a project doesn’t require complicated tools like a bundler or a development server. Essentially, adding JSX is a lot like adding a CSS preprocessor. The only requirement is to have Node.js installed on your computer.
## Card
The Card react for the display of the project one of my first time using Component Card to make it, in the display Text.

## Updating the code to Hooks 
 learn the Basic Hooks
 to import Hook and install hooks it has to run the command npm install hooks 
import {useState} from 'react'
const [advice, setAdvice] = useState([]);
simple understanding how to get the real Hooks work, I update this code with Hooks
Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.
During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value passed as the first argument (initialState).
The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component.
To display the advice in better and fetch the data from the API.
